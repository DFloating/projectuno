# Project Uno

Inspiration: Humans of New York | Medium

 This web application would allow users to create photo essays that tell a larger story about their lives. 
 Users could upload a series of photographs that relate to a particular theme or topic or as a journal entry (e.g. family, work, hobbies), and then write accompanying text to provide context and narrative.

## :rocket: Cool tech
- Programming languages used - Ruby on Rails, CSS Bootstrap and HTML


## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- Currently working on restricting access for users to be able to edit and delete journal entries
- The original idea included the ability to have multiple photos to be uploaded onto a single journal post, however the photo model is currently inactive, meaning there is only capibility for users to upload a single photo

## :sob: Lessons learnt
- Focus less on design and more on getting the model associations working, especially when working on a deadline :cry:

## :white_check_mark: Future features
- An ability for users to organise the placement of photos as they aesthetically please. 
- The design of the website is constantly being updated so WATCH THIS SPACE.....
